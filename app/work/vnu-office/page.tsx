            I briefly joined this project in February 2025 to design the visual interface of the VNU Office app, based on descriptions provided by our team's business analyst. Unfortunately, the project was shelved due to time constraints — but here's what we were able to accomplish during that time.

            Design an internal office application that streamlines project management, fosters transparent communication, and supports diverse workflows across departments at VNU — all while remaining intuitive for users with varying levels of tech experience.

              VNU Office is a centralized platform that enables staff to manage tasks, share documents, and communicate efficiently. By simplifying collaboration and aligning teams around shared goals, the app strengthens day-to-day operations and improves overall coordination within the university.

          <p className="mt-2">
            Working on the app, even briefly, was a valuable experience for me. It taught me how important it is to design with clarity and inclusivity, especially when the users range from tech-savvy staff to those less comfortable with digital tools. Collaborating with our business analyst helped me translate complex requirements into something visual and intuitive — a process I really enjoyed. Although the project was eventually shelved, it reminded me how powerful early design and prototyping can be in shaping direction and aligning a team around shared goals.
